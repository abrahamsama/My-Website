                <h1 class="head-text">About Me</h1>
                <p class="smaller-text">I am a class of '22 Computer Science major originally
					from Eagle Pass, Tx. Coming from a border town, I've come to appreciate
					all the people and resources that have become available to me since I 
                    started attending Texas A&M. 
                    <br> <br>

					I'm involved in plenty extracurricular activities ranging from 
					professional to casual, including <a href="https://www.tamushpe.org/">Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</a>
                    (SHPE), <a href="https://www.tamulegion.com/">LEGION Men's Org</a>, and <a href="https://www.tamupercussionstudio.com/">
                    Percussion Studio</a>. I handpicked these
					organizations freshman and sophomore year based on the networking
					opportunities and overall enjoyment I get out of them. While involved,
					I made some great friends and good people skills that 
                    have prepared me to collaborate in the work force when the time comes.
                    <br> <br>

                    Even with all these extracurricular activities, I still found some time to
                    code. I'm apart of the SHPE Tech Affairs Committee which has taught me 
                    HTML, CSS, and Google Sheet Script, and I have attended numerous 
                    <a href="https://devpost.com/abrahamsama?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature
                    =portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav">hackathons</a>
                    in which I've used similar skills (more on this in <a href="portfolio.html">
                    portfolio</a>).
                    <br> <br>

                    I believe I work really well in a group environment and that is 
                    because I have this genuine love and respect for people. Understanding
                    that humans thrive better with the help of other humans is 
                    the first step into entering a successful career, and I feel like this 
                    fundamental skill sets me apart from other Computer Science majors
                    and engineers. Although I can learn and function on my own 
                    without the aid of others, I know that I can accomplish a whole lot more 
                    when I collaborate with other people.
